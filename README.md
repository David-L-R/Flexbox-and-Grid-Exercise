## 📚 Files

**The only files you should change are**

1. **styles.css**
1. **index.html**

You are allowed to add HTML element if you need them to build flex containers or grid containers.

You should add all layout styles to the **styles.css** file.

The components themselves do not need to be changed. I have created the cards, images, avatars and text for you. This design is inside `components.css` and should not be changed.

## 📕 Instructions

You will get time to complete this task in groups.

1. Start by creating flexbox and grid for the layout of the page.
1. Only if you have time, create flexbox and grid for each section.

Most probably that you will not be able to finish everything withing the time limit!

You can add HTML wrappers (`<div>` for example) in order to create flexbox or grid containers around elements.

You can also add classes to control design.

❗ Make sure to only change `index.html` and `styles.css`. ❗
